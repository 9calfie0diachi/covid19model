# Raw data used
Data on COVID-19-attributed cases and deaths was obtained from the ECDC https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide. 

This data can be found in covid19-ecdc-data.csv.

# Posterior draws from the model
The posterior draws for all the parameters in our model can be found in the posterior-draws folder. In the folder each parameter has its own csv.
